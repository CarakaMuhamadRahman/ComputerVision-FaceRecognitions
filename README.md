Face Recognitions Using Haar Cascade and K-NN Algorithms

The main purpose of this research is to create a face recognition model implemented in the attendance system, using the Haar Cascade method/algorithm to perform feature extractions and face detection, and then K-NN to perform face recognition, with the resulting model accuracy value of 90%.
